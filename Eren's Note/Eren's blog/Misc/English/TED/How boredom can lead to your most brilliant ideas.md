Do you sometimes have your most creative ideas while folding <font color="#9bbb59">laundry</font>, washing dishes or doing nothing <font color="#9bbb59">in particular</font>? It's because when your body goes on autopilot, your brain gets busy forming new <font color="#9bbb59">neural</font> connections that connect ideas and solve problems. Learn to love being bored as Manoush Zomorodi explains the connection between spacing out and creativity.
[[无聊带给我们的绝妙想法]]

My son and the iPhone were born three weeks <font color="#9bbb59">apart</font> in June 2007. So while those early adopters were lined up outside, waiting to get their hands on this <font color="#9bbb59">amazing</font> new <font color="#9bbb59">gadget</font>, I was stuck at home with my hands full of something else that was sending out <font color="#9bbb59">constant</font> notifications --

00:23
(Laughter)

00:25
a <font color="#9bbb59">miserable</font>, <font color="#9bbb59">colicky</font> baby who would only sleep in a moving <font color="#9bbb59">stroller</font> with complete silence. I <font color="#9bbb59">literally</font> was walking 10 to 15 miles a day, and the baby weight came off. That part was great.

00:40
But man, was I bored. Before motherhood, I had been a <font color="#9bbb59">journalist</font> who <font color="#9bbb59">rushed off</font> when the Concorde crashed. I was one of the first people into Belgrade when there was a <font color="#9bbb59">revolution</font> in Serbia. Now, I was <font color="#9bbb59">exhausted</font>. This walking went on for weeks. It was only until about three months in that something <font color="#9bbb59">shifted</font>, though. As I <font color="#9bbb59">pounded</font> the pavement, my mind started to wander, too. I began imagining what I would do when I finally did sleep again.

01:13
So the <font color="#9bbb59">colic</font> did fade, and I finally got an iPhone and I put all those hours of wandering into action. I created my dream job hosting a public radio show. So there was <font color="#9bbb59">no more</font> rushing off to <font color="#9bbb59">war zones</font>, but <font color="#9bbb59">thanks to</font> my new smartphone, I could be a mother and a journalist. I could be on the playground and on Twitter at the same time. Yeah, well, when I thought that, when the technology came in and took over, <font color="#9bbb59">that is when</font> I <font color="#9bbb59">hit a wall</font>.

01:43
So, I want you to <font color="#9bbb59">picture</font> this: you host a <font color="#9bbb59">podcast</font>, and you have to prove that the <font color="#9bbb59">investment</font> of <font color="#9bbb59">precious</font> public radio dollars in you is worth it. My goal was to increase my <font color="#9bbb59">audience</font> size <font color="#9bbb59">tenfold</font>. So one day, I sat down to <font color="#9bbb59">brainstorm</font>, <font color="#9bbb59">as you do</font>, and I <font color="#9bbb59">came up</font> <font color="#9bbb59">barren</font>. This was different than <font color="#9bbb59">writer's block</font>, right? It wasn't like there was something there waiting to be <font color="#9bbb59">unearthed</font>. There was just nothing. And so I started to think back: When was the last time I actually had a good idea? Yeah, it was when I was pushing that <font color="#9bbb59">damn</font> <font color="#9bbb59">stroller</font>. Now all the <font color="#9bbb59">cracks</font> in my day were filled with phone time. I checked the <font color="#9bbb59">headlines</font> while I waited for my <font color="#9bbb59">latte</font>. I updated my calendar while I was sitting on the <font color="#9bbb59">couch</font>. Texting turned every spare moment into a chance to show to my <font color="#9bbb59">coworkers</font> and my dear husband what a <font color="#9bbb59">responsive</font> person I was, or at least it was a chance to find another perfect couch for my page on Pinterest. I realized that I was never bored. And anyway, don't only boring people get bored?

02:48
But then I started to <font color="#9bbb59">wonder</font>: What <font color="#9bbb59">actually</font> happens to us when we get bored? Or, more importantly: What happens to us if we never get bored? And what could happen if we got rid of this human emotion entirely? I started talking to <font color="#9bbb59">neuroscientists</font> and <font color="#9bbb59">cognitive</font> <font color="#9bbb59">psychologists</font>, and what they told me was <font color="#9bbb59">fascinating</font>. It turns out that when you get bored, you <font color="#9bbb59">ignite</font> a network in your brain called the "default mode." So our body, it goes on <font color="#9bbb59">autopilot</font> while we're <font color="#9bbb59">folding the laundry</font> or we're walking to work, but actually that is when our brain gets really busy. Here's boredom researcher Dr. Sandi Mann.

03:27
(Audio) Dr. Sandi Mann: Once you start daydreaming and allow your mind to really wander, you start thinking a little bit <font color="#9bbb59">beyond</font> the <font color="#9bbb59">conscious</font>, a little bit into the <font color="#9bbb59">subconscious</font>, which allows sort of different connections to take place. It's really awesome, actually.

03:41
Manoush Zomorodi: Totally awesome, right?

03:43
So this is my brain in an fMRI, and I learned that in the default mode is when we connect <font color="#9bbb59">disparate</font> ideas, we solve some of our most <font color="#9bbb59">nagging</font> problems, and we do something called "autobiographical planning." This is when we look back at our lives, we take note of the big moments, we create a <font color="#9bbb59">personal narrative</font>, and then we set goals and we figure out what steps we need to take to reach them. But now we <font color="#9bbb59">chill</font> out on the couch also while updating a Google Doc or replying to email. We call it "getting shit done," but here's what <font color="#9bbb59">neuroscientist</font> Dr. Daniel Levitin says we're actually doing.

04:19
(Audio) Dr. Daniel Levitin: Every time you <font color="#9bbb59">shift</font> your attention from one thing to another, the brain has to <font color="#9bbb59">engage</font> a <font color="#9bbb59">neurochemical</font> switch that <font color="#9bbb59">uses up</font> <font color="#9bbb59">nutrients </font>in the brain to accomplish that. So if you're attempting to multitask, you know, doing four or five things at once, you're not actually doing four or five things at once, because the brain doesn't work that way. Instead, you're <font color="#9bbb59">rapidly</font> <font color="#9bbb59">shifting</font> from one thing to the next, <font color="#9bbb59">depleting</font> <font color="#9bbb59">neural</font> resources as you go.

04:43
(Audio) MZ: So switch, switch, switch, you're using <font color="#9bbb59">glucose</font>, glucose, glucose.

04:47
(Audio) DL: <font color="#9bbb59">Exactly</font> right, and we have a limited <font color="#9bbb59">supply</font> of that <font color="#9bbb59">stuff</font>.

04:51
MZ: A <font color="#9bbb59">decade</font> ago, we shifted our attention at work every three minutes. Now we do it every 45 seconds, and we do it all day long. The average person checks email 74 times a day, and switches tasks on their computer 566 times a day. I discovered all this talking to professor of <font color="#9bbb59">informatics</font>, Dr. Gloria Mark.

05:14
(Audio) Dr. Gloria Mark: So we find that when people are stressed, they tend to shift their attention more rapidly. We also found, <font color="#9bbb59">strangely</font> enough, that the shorter the amount of sleep that a person gets, the more likely they are to check Facebook. So we're in this <font color="#9bbb59">vicious</font>, <font color="#9bbb59">habitual</font> <font color="#9bbb59">cycle</font>.

05:35
MZ: But could this cycle be broken? What would happen if we broke this vicious cycle? Maybe my listeners could help me find out. What if we <font color="#9bbb59">reclaimed</font> those cracks in our day? Could it help us jump-start our creativity? We called the project "Bored and <font color="#9bbb59">Brilliant</font>." And I expected, you know, a couple hundred people to play along, but thousands of people started <font color="#9bbb59">signing up</font>. And they told me the reason they were doing it was because they were worried that their relationship with their phone had grown kind of ... "<font color="#9bbb59">codependent</font>," shall we say.

06:15
(Audio) Man: The relationship between a baby and its teddy bear or a baby and its binky or a baby that wants its mother's cradle when it's done with being held by a stranger --

06:27
(Laughs)

06:28
that's the relationship between me and my phone.

06:31
(Audio) Woman: I think of my phone like a power tool: <font color="#9bbb59">extremely</font> useful, but dangerous if I'm not handling it <font color="#9bbb59">properly</font>.

06:38
(Audio) Woman 2: If I don't pay close attention, I'll suddenly realize that I've lost an hour of time doing something <font color="#9bbb59">totally</font> <font color="#9bbb59">mindless</font>.

06:45
MZ: OK, but to really measure any improvement, we needed data, right? Because that's what we do these days. So we partnered with some apps that would measure how much time we were spending every day on our phone. If you're thinking it's <font color="#9bbb59">ironic</font> that I asked people to download another app so that they would spend less time on their phones: yeah, but you gotta meet people where they are.

07:04
(Laughter)

07:06
So before challenge week, we were averaging two hours a day on our phones and 60 pickups, you know, like, a quick check, did I get a new email? Here's what Tina, a student at Bard College, discovered about herself.

07:20
(Audio) Tina: So far, I've been spending between 150 and 200 minutes on my phone per day, and I've been picking up my phone 70 to 100 times per day. And it's really <font color="#9bbb59">concerning</font>, because that's so much time that I could have spent doing something more <font color="#9bbb59">productive</font>, more <font color="#9bbb59">creative</font>, more towards myself, because when I'm on my phone, I'm not doing anything important.

07:40
MZ: Like Tina, people were starting to observe their own behavior. They were getting ready for challenge week. And that Monday, they started to wake up to instructions in their inbox, an experiment to try.

07:53
Day one: "Put it in your pocket." Take that phone out of your hand. See if you can <font color="#9bbb59">eliminate</font> the reflex to check it all day long, just for a day. And if this sounds easy, you haven't tried it. Here's listener Amanda Itzko.

08:08
(Audio) Amanda Itzko: I am <font color="#9bbb59">absolutely</font> <font color="#9bbb59">itching</font>. I feel a little bit crazy, because I have noticed that I pick up my phone when I'm just walking from one room to another, getting on the <font color="#9bbb59">elevator</font>, and even -- and this is the part that I am really <font color="#9bbb59">embarrassed</font> to actually say out loud -- in the car.

08:31
MZ: Yikes. Yeah, well, but as Amanda learned, this itching feeling is not actually her fault. That is <font color="#9bbb59">exactly</font> the behavior that the technology is built to <font color="#9bbb59">trigger</font>.

08:42
(Laughter)

08:47
I mean, right? Here's <font color="#9bbb59">former</font> Google designer, Tristan Harris.

08:52
(Audio) Tristan Harris: If I'm Facebook or I'm Netflix or I'm Snapchat, I have <font color="#9bbb59">literally</font> a thousand engineers whose job is to get more attention from you. I'm very good at this, and I don't want you to ever stop. And you know, the CEO of Netflix recently said, "Our biggest competitors are Facebook, YouTube and sleep." I mean, so there's a million places to spend your attention, but there's a war going on to get it.

09:14
MZ: I mean, you know the feeling: that <font color="#9bbb59">amazing</font> <font color="#9bbb59">episode</font> of "<font color="#9bbb59">Transparent</font>" ends, and then the next one starts playing so you're like, eh, OK fine, I'll just stay up and watch it. Or the LinkedIn progress bar says you are this close to having the perfect <font color="#9bbb59">profile</font>, so you add a little more personal information. As one UX designer told me, the only people who refer to their customers as "users" are drug <font color="#9bbb59">dealers</font> and technologists.

09:39
(Laughter)

09:40
(Applause)

09:46
And users, as we know, are worth a lot of money. Here's former Facebook product manager and author, Antonio García Martínez.

09:57
(Audio) Antonio García Martínez: The saying is, if any product is free then you're the product; your attention is the product. But what is your attention worth? That's why <font color="#9bbb59">literally</font> every time you load a page, not just on Facebook or any app, there's an <font color="#9bbb59">auction</font> being held <font color="#9bbb59">instantly</font>, billions of times a day, for <font color="#9bbb59">exactly</font> how much that one ad impression cost.

10:13
MZ: <font color="#9bbb59">By the way</font>, the average person will spend two years of their life on Facebook. So, back to challenge week. <font color="#9bbb59">Immediately</font>, we saw some creativity kick in. Here's New Yorker Lisa Alpert.

10:26
(Audio) Lisa Alpert: I was bored, I guess. So I suddenly looked at the <font color="#9bbb59">stairway</font> that went up to the top of the <font color="#9bbb59">station</font>, and I thought, you know, I had just come down that stairway, but I could go back up and then come back down and get a little <font color="#9bbb59">cardio</font>. So I did, and then I had a little more time, so I did it again and I did it again, and I did it 10 times. And I had a complete cardio <font color="#9bbb59">workout</font>. I got on that R train feeling kind of <font color="#9bbb59">exhausted</font>, but, like, wow, that had never occurred to me. How is that possible?

10:56
(Laughter)

10:57
MZ: So creativity, I learned, means different things to different people.

11:01
(Laughter)

11:02
But everyone found day three's challenge the hardest. It was called "Delete that app." Take that app -- you know the one; that one that always gets you, it sucks you in -- take it off your phone, even if just for the day. I deleted the game Two Dots and nearly cried.

11:18
(Laughter)

11:19
Yeah, Two Dots players know what I'm talking about. But my <font color="#9bbb59">misery</font> had good company.

11:27
(Audio) Man 2: This is Liam in Los Angeles, and I deleted Twitter, Facebook, Instagram, Tumblr, Snapchat and Vine from my phone in one fell swoop. And it was kind of an <font color="#9bbb59">embarrassingly</font> <font color="#9bbb59">emotional</font> experience at first. It felt <font color="#9bbb59">weirdly</font> lonely to look at that lock screen with no new notifications on it. But I really liked deciding for myself when to think about or access my social networks, not giving my phone the power to decide that for me. So thank you.

12:00
(Audio) Woman 3: Deleting the Twitter app was very sad, and I feel I maybe, over the last year when I've been on Twitter, have developed an addiction to it, and this "Bored and Brilliant" challenge has really made me realize it. After a <font color="#9bbb59">brief</font> period of really <font color="#9bbb59">horrible</font> <font color="#9bbb59">withdrawal</font> feeling, like lack-of-<font color="#9bbb59">caffeine</font> <font color="#9bbb59">headache</font>, I now feel lovely. I had a lovely dinner with my family, and I hope to continue this <font color="#9bbb59">structured</font> use of these powerful tools.

12:25
(Audio) Woman 4: I don't have that <font color="#9bbb59">guilty</font> gut feeling I have when I know I'm wasting time on my phone. Maybe I'll have to start giving myself challenges and <font color="#9bbb59">reminders</font> like this every morning.

12:34
MZ: I mean, yes, this was progress. I could not wait to see what the numbers said at the end of that week. But when the data came in, it turned out that we had cut down, <font color="#9bbb59">on average</font>, just six minutes -- from 120 minutes a day on our phones to 114. Yeah. Whoop-de-do.

12:56
So I went back to the scientists feeling kind of low, and they just laughed at me, and they said, you know, changing people's behavior in such a short time period was <font color="#9bbb59">ridiculously</font> <font color="#9bbb59">ambitious</font>, and actually what you've achieved is far beyond what we thought possible. Because more important than the numbers, were the people's stories. They felt <font color="#9bbb59">empowered</font>. Their phones had been transformed from taskmasters back into tools.

13:26
And actually, I found what the young people said most <font color="#9bbb59">intriguing</font>. Some of them told me that they didn't <font color="#9bbb59">recognize</font> some of the emotions that they felt during challenge week, because, if you think about it, if you have never known life without connectivity, you may never have experienced boredom. And there could be <font color="#9bbb59">consequences</font>. Researchers at USC have found -- they're studying teenagers who are on <font color="#9bbb59">social media</font> while they're talking to their friends or they're doing homework, and two years down the road, they are less creative and imaginative about their own personal futures and about solving societal problems, like violence in their neighborhoods. And we really need this next generation to be able to focus on some big problems: climate change, economic disparity, <font color="#9bbb59">massive</font> cultural differences. No wonder CEOs in an IBM survey identified creativity as the number one <font color="#9bbb59">leadership</font> <font color="#9bbb59">competency</font>.

14:21
OK, here's the good news, though: In the end, 20,000 people did "Bored and Brilliant" that week. Ninety percent cut down on their minutes. Seventy percent got more time to think. People told me that they slept better. They felt happier. My favorite note was from a guy who said he felt like he was waking up from a <font color="#9bbb59">mental</font> <font color="#9bbb59">hibernation</font>.

14:43
Some personal data and some neuroscience gave us <font color="#9bbb59">permission</font> to be <font color="#9bbb59">offline</font> a little bit more, and a little bit of boredom gave us some <font color="#9bbb59">clarity</font> and helped some of us set some goals. I mean, maybe constant connectivity won't be cool in a couple of years. But <font color="#9bbb59">meanwhile</font>, teaching people, especially kids, how to use technology to improve their lives and to <font color="#9bbb59">self-regulate</font> needs to be part of <font color="#9bbb59">digital</font> <font color="#9bbb59">literacy</font>.

15:14
So the next time you go to check your phone, remember that if you don't decide how you're going to use the technology, the platforms will decide for you. And ask yourself: What am I really looking for? Because if it's to check email, that's fine -- do it and be done. But if it's to <font color="#9bbb59">distract</font> yourself from doing the hard work that comes with deeper thinking, take a break, stare out the window and know that by doing nothing you are actually being your most <font color="#9bbb59">productive</font> and <font color="#9bbb59">creative</font> self. It might feel <font color="#9bbb59">weird</font> and <font color="#9bbb59">uncomfortable</font> at first, but <font color="#9bbb59">boredom</font> truly can lead to <font color="#9bbb59">brilliance</font>.

15:53
Thank you.

15:55
(Applause)
